# IBMWatsonHackathon
This is the project that I created during the IBM Finish Line Technical Challenge event.
The solution I describe is the add on chatbot for enterprise messaging platforms that analyzes teams' sentiment/mood and key discussion topics.
The solution enables team leads' to follow their team's progress more efficiently and enhances employee satisfaction.
