# IBMWatsonHackathon
This is the project that I created during the IBM Finish Line Technical Challenge event.
The solution I describe is the add on chatbot for enterprise messaging platforms that analyzes teams' sentiment/mood and key discussion topics.
The solution enables team leads' to follow their team's progress more efficiently and enhances employee satisfaction. 
I used IBM Watson Natural Language Understanding for sentiment analysis, Slack messaging platform and IBM NodeRed for creating a prototype.

Here is the sample screenshot of the app in action:
